# PlayerController-Unity-
In this Repository, the main concepts of control options assigned to a player like front arrow for accelerate and spacebar for handbrake are practised for improve delicacy while handling player controls and providing an improved overall performace!
//Summary
In this Unit, you will program a car moving side-to-side on a floating road, trying to avoid (or hit) obstacles in the way. In addition to becoming familiar with the Unity editor and workflow, you will learn how to create new C# scripts and do some simple programming. By the end of the Unit, you will be able to call basic functions, then declare and tweak new variables to modify the results of those functions. 

//Topics we'll cover
Level 1 Application Scripting
      Implement appropriate data types
      Implement a code style that is efficient and easy to read
      Prototype new concepts
Level 1 Debugging
      Diagnose and fix code that compiles, but fails to perform as expected
Level 1 Code Comprehension
       Interpret simple code
       Improve simple code using the features of an IDE

//By the end of this Unit, you will be able to:
     Navigate 3D space and the Unity Editor comfortably
     Add and manipulate objects in the scene to position them where you want, including the camera
     Control the layout of Unity Editor to suit your needs
     Create C# scripts and apply them to objects
     Use Visual Studio and a few of its basic features
     Add Rigidbody and Collider components to allow objects to collide realistically 
     Declare variables properly and initialize/assign them with appropriate access modifiers
